# Steam Activator for Alfred.app #

Activate new product keys on Steam quickly and easily using [Alfred.app](http://alfredapp.com).

## Usage ##

You have 2 options, either copy the product key to the clipboard and execute `steamer` in Alfred or execute `steamer product-key`.

## Configuration ##

Shouldn't be any needed, but if you find that it appears Steam isn't changing windows fast enough and things aren't activating properly you can change the delay between commands.  The default is 3/4 of a second and that works well on my iMac.

{{{applescript
    	set myDelay to 0.75
}}}
